            <p><strong>About the Cards and Website</strong><br>
            There are hundreds of cards to be rotated through, and if you stay within the same computer or device you should not see the same word twice until you run through the entire deck. There are certain exceptions such as when there is an update done to the site, etc.</p>

            <p><strong>About Taboo</strong><br>
            Taboo is a fast-paced team game where players try to get their teammates to guess a specific word without using a list of “taboo” words that are closely related to it.</p>
